	  Choose this option to enable mediatek misc iommu driver.
	  Misc iommu includes the enhanced features about iommu hardware.
	  For example, it can implement iommu secure driver for secure
	  feature or debug feature.

	  Choose this option to enable mediatek secure iommu driver.
	  For SVP or secure camera feature, user only can access
	  continuous secure memory, and the number of secure memory's
	  bit no more than 32. So the secure memory need to map to mva
	  by m4u. Secure m4u driver can map non-physical continuous
	  secure memory to continuous modified virtual address.

	tristate "Enable Mediatek IOMMU debug feature"
	depends on MTK_IOMMU_MISC
	help
	  Choose this option to enable mediatek iommu debug driver.
	  According to the characteristic of hardware, we need to add
	  some debug information. For example translation fault, hardware
	  dump information and so on. In addition, for ion buffer, we can
	  use dma_buf information to monitor iova, but if user use
	  "dma_alloc_attrs" to allocate buffer, we can not monitor iova.
	  So we can use list to save all iova node and dump it.
